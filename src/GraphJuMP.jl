"""
Several formulations of the flows are possible: 

* `EdgeFlow`: each edge of the graph is explicitly modelled. This model tends to scale poorly to large number of nodes 
  and edges in the graph
* `Path`: only some paths in the graph are modelled. This formulation is typical for column-generation schemes
  (set `delayed=true` for this)

To create a new formulation, subtype `GraphFormulation` and `GraphFormulationExt`; implement the required functions: 

* `supportspath(::GraphFormulation)`: whether this formulation uses the notion of path. This implies that functions like 
  `addpath!` must be supported. 
* `buildformulation(m::Model, gf::GraphFormulation)`: builds the formulation, i.e. creates the required JuMP variables and
  constraints for the formulation.
